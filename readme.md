## Capisso VMPanel [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Capisso/VMPanel.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Capisso/VMPanel)

I don't recommend downloading Capisso VMPanel from the Github repository to install, instead grab a zip/tar from the website and use that.

Please note this software is _not_ production ready and is in it's early stages of development.
